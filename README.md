# Text to Image using LangChain Python
 in a short description   LangChain helps you build text-to-image apps by managing the prompt engineering process.  It uses an LLM to refine user text into detailed prompts for image generation models (like Stable Diffusion).  You'll need to connect it to an actual image generation API to create the images.  Edan.ai likely uses a similar approach but with proprietary LLMs and optimizations.
